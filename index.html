                Hello World, my name is Lawren Jacqueline Sabino but I just 
                go by Jacqui, sorry for any confusion! I was born and raised in Memphis Tennessee. 
                I moved to Texas in high school and have been here since. I recently graduated with a Bachelor’s in
                Computer Science from the University of Texas at Austin. 
                I have a passion for technology and labor activism and am constantly looking for ways to 
                integrate modern and new advances in technology to every day problems! 
                Please ask and tell me your opinions on AI, information security, and privacy.
                </p>
                <h4>My "Tech" Philosophy</h4><p>
                This is a loosely structured and researched framework for how I navigate the 
                tech world. This includes academic research, legislative development, current market products, open sourced 
                alternatvies and most importantly, the problems we seek to solve with them. For conetxt, I did not learn how to code until college. 
                Regardless, of how much I type and how much I learn, the reality of tech is that it changes 
                in the blink of an eye. Perhaps the architecture has shifted, our transistors have gotten smaller and 
                a new programming language is always on the rise. But the fundamentals always remain pretty consistent. 

                My current passion that I hope to work towards in my postbaccalaureate is creating an energy conscious tech field. 
                I hope to discover ways of utilizing renewable energy, further algorithm optimization, and even material conscious 
                hardware. I refuse to believe we can only advance technologically by endless extraction and sacrificng non-renewables.
