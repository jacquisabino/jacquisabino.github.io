                <p>
                    Our database provides administrative staff at the Public Works Department with a
                    structure for tracking information about reported potholes, users submitting damage
                    reports, equipment and employees. To do this we defined eight entities as described
                    and modeled in our UML diagram
                </p>
                <h4>WORK_ORDER</h4>
                <p>
                    Purpose: To provide information about how a pothole has been chosen to be
                    handled. So users can file a damage report or a pothole can just exist, but until
                    an administrator files a work order on the pothole it won’t be fixed. Work orders
                    can be inactive for various reasons (hasn’t started, holidays, repaired,
                    administrative issues, etc...). Also provides a start and end date for the repair.
                    Children:

                <h5>POTHOLE</h5>
                <p>
                    A work order must be associated with one pothole. However,
                    a pothole can be associated with 0 or 1 work orders
                </p>
                <h5>WORK CREW</h5>
                <p>
                    A work order must be associated with one work crew. But
                    a work crew can be associated with 0 or 1 work orders. (Constraint: A
                    work order cannot be inactive with an active work crew assigned to it)
                    (Constraint: A work order can be created prior to work crew but the
                    project can't start before work crew is created).
                </p>
                <h4>WORK_CREW</h4>
                <p>
                    Purpose: To provide information about the group of workers assigned to repair a
                    certain pothole through a work order. A work crew can exist without having been
                    assigned a work order but can be assigned to at most one work order.
                </p>
                <h4>EQUIPMENT</h4>
                <p>
                    Purpose: To provide information about the equipment used to repair a certain
                    pothole through an issued work order.
                    Children: 
                </p>
                <h5>WORK_ORDER</h5>
                <p>
                    A work order has 1 or many equipment assigned to it. 1
                    or many equipment can be associated with 0 or 1 work orders. This is to
                    highlight that equipment exists (and possibly free to assign), without a
                    work order existing for it.             
                </p>
                <h4>WORKER</h4>
                <p>
                    Purpose: To provide information about a worker assigned to repair a certain
                    pothole as part of a work crew.
                    Children:
                </p>
                <h5>WORK_CREW:</h5>
                <p>
                    A work crew is made up of 1 to many workers. The
                    number of workers per work crew can vary. A worker can only be
                    assigned to 0 or 1 work crews. A worker can exist without being assigned
                    to a work crew.     
                </p>
                <h4>USER</h4>
                <p>
                    Purpose: To provide information about a user who’s filed a damage report about
                    a certain pothole. A user’s first name, last name and phone number can be used
                    as an alternative key. Additionally, the phone number itself can be an alternative
                    key.
                    Children:
                </p>
                <h5>RESIDENCE_ADDRESS</h5>
                <p>
                    Each user must be associated with one
                    address. One address can be associated with 1 or more users. This is to
                    highlight that many people living in the same place can file reports on
                    potholes.
                </p>
                <h4>DAMAGE_REPORT</h4>
                <p>
                    Purpose: To provide information about the report a user has made on a pothole
                    and the damage associated with it.  
                    Children:        
                </p>
                <h5>POTHOLE</h5>
                <p>
                    A damage report must be associated with one pothole.
                    However a pothole can be associated with 0 or 1 damage reports. In our
                    design we chose to highlight that a pothole can exist without someone
                    having filed a damage report on it.
                </p>
                <h5>USER</h5>
                <p>
                    A user can have made 1 or more damage reports. A damage
                    report can only be associated with a single user
                </p>
                <h4>POTHOLE</h4>
                <p>
                    Purpose: To provide information about existing potholes including size, location,
                    and whether it’s be repaired. Repair priority and district are derived attributes.
                    Repair priority will be calculated by the size of pothole and district by street
                    address.
                </p>
                <h4>RESIDENCE_ADDRESS</h4>
                <p>
                    Purpose: To provide information about where a user who’s filed a damage report
                    lives.
